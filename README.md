# hidden-files

Extension for Chrome to hide files by extensions on github repos.
It also works with Octotree (an extension for a tree view of the code) :
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octotree-github-code-tree/bkhaagjahfmjljalopjnoealnfndnagc

I don't want to pay the registration fees for the store, so here is how you can install it ðŸ‘€ :

- Enable Developer mode
- Clone the repo and load it
- Disable Developer mode
- You can now go to the extension's options and choose what files you want to hide
